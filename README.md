The game is built using html5 and javaScript. index.html, css, engine.js, resouce.js and images are downloadeded or cloned from udacity repository. Editting the app.js to build the game is realy a great experiance. I learned how to use classes, methods, Object-Oriented JavaScript, this and Object prototypes. Some of the methods I learned are:
* The render method
* The update method
* The render method
* The handleInput method,
